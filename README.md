# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

## Overview

Reviewing Python fundamentals with Harvard's CS50P course. 

For each week's material, lecture examples are stored in one folder and completed problems sets in another.

## Licence

The contents of this repository are adapted from the course materials for Harvard University's [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course, the licence for which can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/license/). 

Solutions to the problem sets are my own work. The original exercises are available to view [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/).

I would like to thank Harvard University and Professor David Malan for making this course available to all.
